This repository contains two integrated datasets and a machine learning-based approach for fraud detection in e-commerce transactions. The project applies comprehensive data preprocessing techniques, including feature transformation (e.g., converting IP addresses to numeric values, calculating account age) and probabilistic sampling for imputing missing values. Key transaction-related features—such as customer demographics, payment methods, device types, and browser usage—are analyzed to identify patterns associated with fraudulent behavior. Statistical methods are used to compute frequencies and distributions of categorical variables, providing deeper insights into the data. The findings highlight how effective preprocessing and feature engineering enhance model performance, leading to more accurate fraud detection in e-commerce platforms.
